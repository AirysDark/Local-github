# Local-github — full dropdowns for Wi‑Fi country + Keyboard

This package updates the workflow so **Wi‑Fi country code** is a full ISO list dropdown, and **Keyboard layout** is a large dropdown (with a `custom` fallback).

- Edit values in the **Actions → workflow_dispatch** form.
- If you select `keyboard=custom`, set `keyboard_custom` to any valid XKB layout string (e.g. `us`, `gb`, `au`, `us,intl`, etc.).
- Targets `pi` and `pc` are wired; generics/i860 are placeholders here.
