# Local-github (Pi Real Build)

Use GitHub Actions -> "Build Local-github (Pi Real Build)" to produce a Raspberry Pi OS image
with your combined dropdowns for credentials, SSH policy, static IPv4, Wiâ€‘Fi country, timezone, and keyboard.

The workflow vendors minimal overlays into `pi-gen/stage4/05-local-github/files/` so your selections
are baked into the image.
