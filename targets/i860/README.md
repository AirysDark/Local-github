# i860 target (placeholder)

The Intel i860 architecture is not supported by Debian or standard cross-build tools.
This directory is a **template**. You would need:
- A kernel/toolchain that targets i860
- A C library and userland port for i860
- A bootloader for your i860 platform

Script placeholder provided below.
